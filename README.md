# ASTRA Base Station

Welcome! This is the repository for UAH's ASTRA Base Station for the University
Rover Challenge in 2025.

ASTRA is a project under the AutoSat branch of Space Hardware Club as part of
The University of Alabama in Huntsville.

## If you're on basestation and no one is there to help you

These instructions are for:

- People learning to use arm.
- People learning to use core.
- McGinnis that time Riley slept in too long during SAR filming.

1. Open up VSCode and navigate to the `rover-Basestation-Release` project.
   Ensure that the title of the window includes
   "Dev Container: Basestation Release". If it doesn't, bring up the command
   palette with `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` and run the
   `>Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` command.

2. Do `ctrl` + `shift` + `b` to run the launch task.

3. Navigate to <https://localhost> in Firefox and behold Basestation in all
   of its glory. You may have to dismiss a warning to view the page. Click
   advanced and then visit the site anyways.

## Getting Started
